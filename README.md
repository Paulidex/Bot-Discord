# Bot-Discord
This Discord bot streamlines Minecraft server management, providing rules, server IP, in-game commands, and donation links. Built with Pythonâ€™s discord.py, it includes automated status updates and runs continuously via a Flask web server, preventing idle timeouts. It enhances community engagement with quick access to essential server info.
